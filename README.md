# Mathematical & Demographic Modeling Project

This repository brings together three complementary projects exploring **mathematical models, numerical methods, and demographic simulations**.
The goal is to study **exponential growth**, **predator-prey dynamics**, and **population evolution** using both analytical and computational approaches.

## Exponential Function, Approximation, and Population Growth â€” TP1.py

This module focuses on the **exponential function** and its approximations:

* Series expansions and convergence proofs
* Approximation of \$e = \exp(1)\$
* Eulerâ€™s and Newtonâ€™s methods for numerical solutions
* Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio
* Population growth models (exponential vs logistic)

## Lotka-Volterra Predator-Prey Models and Variants â€” TP2.py

This module explores **predator-prey dynamics** through Lotka-Volterra equations and extensions:

* **M1**: Basic Lotka-Volterra model
* **M2**: Model with scaling and change of variables
* **M3**: Logistic growth model for prey
* Eulerâ€™s and Heunâ€™s methods for numerical approximation
* Phase portraits, direction fields, and stability analysis

## Demographic Modeling â€” TP3.py

This module contains a **demographic simulation script** based on 2016 baseline data:

* Forward and backward simulations (2016 â†’ target year, or inverse)
* Aggregation by age groups and mortality modeling
* Visualizations: 2D overlays, 3D surfaces, bar charts
* Interactive console menu and CLI usage

## Requirements

Each module is Python-based and relies on **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**.
Some parts also use **Pandas** for CSV data handling.

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
```
